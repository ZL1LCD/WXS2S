**Please read the manual**

WXS2S or WX-Sat-2-SSTV is a program designed to fetch satellite images from a web server periodically then transmit them in the Robot 36 SSTV format. 

By default the program is set up to fetch images from KiwiWether.com (Thanks to ZL1MDE for their work on KiwiWeather!) and transmit them every 2 hours.

**WXS2S is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Images produced SHOULD NOT be used for meteorological use.**
